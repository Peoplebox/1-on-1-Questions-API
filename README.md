So decided to built an API to allow  access all questions and their categories along with the **upvoted count**. 

## Overview

# Questions API

## URI and Versioning

We hope to improve the API over time. The changes won't always be backward compatible, so we're going to use versioning. This first iteration will have URIs prefixed with `https://api.peoplebox.ai/v1/` and is structured as described below. There is currently no rate limit.

For versioning purposes, only removal of a non-optional field or alteration of an existing field will be considered incompatible changes. *Clients should gracefully handle additional fields they don't expect, and simply ignore them.*

The API's to fetch information related to questions are as follows -
